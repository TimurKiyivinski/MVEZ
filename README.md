# MVEZ [WIP]
A reactive search-oriented launcher for Android; Pronounced `move-easy`.

## about
MVEZ is a re-implementation of [MUEZ](https://github.com/TimurKiyivinski/muez) as a personal growth project to explore:
* Kotlin
* RxJava

I also wanted to cut down on the features that MUEZ had inherited from its original project and reimplement it as an opinionated launcher with only the defaults and features I need.

## features
- [x] Application search filter
- [x] Named overlay scrolling
- [ ] Settings activity
- [ ] !Bang search syntax

## support
Android Nougat++
